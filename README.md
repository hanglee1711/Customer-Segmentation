# Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation for a business using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering. The goal is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer relationship management.

# Steps Involved
- Data Collection: Gather customer transaction data, including transaction dates, amounts, and customer IDs.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries.
Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of key variables, such as purchase frequency and monetary value.
- Visualizations:
  + Histograms and box plots to visualize the distribution of transaction amounts and frequencies.
  + Time series analysis to observe trends in customer purchases over time.
  + Heatmaps or correlation matrices to examine relationships between different variables.
- RFM Analysis:
  + Recency: Calculate the number of days since the last purchase for each customer.
  + Frequency: Count the number of purchases made by each customer over a specified time period.
  + Monetary: Calculate the total spending of each customer within the same time frame.
  + RFM Scoring: Assign scores to each customer for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, with higher scores indicating better performance.
- Feature Preparation: Create an RFM dataframe containing the RFM scores for each customer, which will serve as the input for clustering.
- K-Means Clustering:
  + Choosing the Number of Clusters: Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the explained variance against the number of clusters.
  + K-Means Implementation: Apply the K-Means algorithm to segment customers based on their RFM scores.
  + Cluster Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to identify distinct customer segments (e.g., high-value customers, at-risk customers, etc.).
- Visualization of Clusters:
  + Use scatter plots or 3D plots to visualize the clusters formed by K-Means, illustrating the distribution of customers based on RFM scores.
- Insights and Recommendations:
  + Summarize findings from the segmentation analysis, highlighting key characteristics of each customer segment.
  + Provide actionable recommendations for targeted marketing strategies, customer retention efforts, and resource allocation based on the identified segments.
